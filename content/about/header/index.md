<!-- this is a subheadline -->
  Before joining [UTHealth](https://sph.uth.edu/faculty/#d8BSUv4jdG1rELwdwMYohg==) in 2018, I served as Associate Director of Statistic at Pfizer. Inc, where I supported various design and analysis of early phase clinical trials, particularly those using data collected from wearable devices. During this time, I was the lead statistician for several projects investigating circadian rhythms including actigraphy, core body temperature, heart rate, sleep, and dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) data. I also supported several projects to evaluate biomarkers for circadian patterns using publicly available databases such as the UKBiobank.
  
  I also worked as Biometrician for wildlife conservation in Alaska,  during which I was first introduced to spatial statistics and became interested in this topic. This work experience motivated me to pursue my Ph.D. in the University of Washington.
